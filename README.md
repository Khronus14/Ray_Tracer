# Ray Tracer

This application reproduces Turner Whitted's ray tracing demonstration image (Figure 7) from his 1980 paper "An Improved Illumination Model for Shaded Display".

Scripts all run in a browser; I used Chrome version 113. Only library used was glMatrix. The files will need to be opened in an IDE (I used WebStorm version 2023.1.1) or hosted on the web. 
Otherwise, clicking on the html file will cause a CORS policy exception and prevent pages from loading correctly.
